We have known for a long time that we should have improved the situation of our
old website. We finally decided to act and what you are seeing now is the result.

It's a pleasure to welcome you to new website. We updated some of the content—especially
in the :doc:`Downloads </downloads>` page—and revamped the template
with some modern css (thanks to `Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_!).
In addition, we added news and comments support. We hope this will make it easier
to follow the development of mplayer2 without the time investment required to
read the git commits log.

This website is now powered by `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ and
is open source: the code is available over at `GitHub <https://github.com/mplayer2/mplayer2.org>`_ —
contributions in the form of pull requests are really welcome!

Please take your time to explore our new website, and leave us feedback using disqus!
