.. title: Welcome to the new website

It's a pleasure to welcome you to our new website. We updated some of the
content—especially in the :doc:`Downloads </downloads>` page—and revamped the template
with some modern CSS based on `Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_.

In addition, we added news and comments support. We hope this will make it easier
to follow the development of mplayer2 without the time investment required to
read the git commits log.

This website is now powered by `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ and
is open source: the code is available over at
`GitHub <https://github.com/mplayer2/mplayer2.org>`_—contributions
in the form of pull requests are really welcome!

Some of the pages—like the :doc:`comparison </differences>` and the
:doc:`faq </faq>`—are still outdated. We hope this new infrastructure will
help us to make and keep the content up to date.

Please take your time to explore our new website, and leave us feedback using
disqus!
